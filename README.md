# Website-Analysis-MA-Court-System
This project aims at target pain-points on MA Court System Website and provide suggestions. The data is from Google Analytics and feedback survey from Massachusetts Court System. We conduct detailed analysis on District Court web traffic before and after Covid-19. We also bring in public policy oreder data and apply Vector Auto Regression (VAR)to find the relationship between web traffic and public policy order. The Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model are used for targeting specific content types which are problematic.
